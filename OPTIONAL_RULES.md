# Optional Rules for Finest 9

These optional rules can be added to the base game to increase complexity, add player interaction, or create new strategic depth. Mix and match as desired!

## Immediate Tactical Rules

### Combo Bonus
**Rewards consecutive successful matches**

* If you capture cards on 3 or more consecutive turns, multiply your points from the final capture by the number of consecutive captures
* The combo breaks if you draw a card or fail to match
* Example: On your 3rd consecutive matching turn, the captured cards score 3x points
* On your 4th consecutive turn, they score 4x points, etc.

**Strategic Impact:** Encourages aggressive play and risk-taking to maintain combos

---

### Double Down
**High risk, high reward once per game**

* Once per game, before rolling the dice, you may declare "Double Down"
* If you successfully match, score double points for that capture
* If you don't match, you must draw TWO cards instead of one

**Strategic Impact:** Creates memorable moments and comeback opportunities

---

## Player Interaction Rules

### Steal
**Rolling 7 gives you options**

* When you roll a **7** (the most common roll), you may choose to either:
  - Match normally from your own cards, OR
  - "Steal" one face-up card from an opponent and add it to your tableau
* Stolen cards go directly to your tableau face-up (they are not captured)

**Strategic Impact:** Makes 7's tactical and adds direct player interaction

---

### Block
**Defend against big captures**

* When an opponent rolls and matches cards worth 15+ points total, you may discard one of your face-up cards to reduce their capture by one card
* The opponent chooses which card to keep on their tableau (not captured)
* You may only block once per round (after all players have taken a turn)

**Strategic Impact:** Adds defensive options and prevents runaway leads

---

### Trade
**Negotiation between players**

* Once per round (after each player has gone once), any two players may trade one face-up card each if both agree
* Both cards must be traded simultaneously
* No other compensation (like points) can be part of the trade

**Strategic Impact:** Adds negotiation and social dynamics

---

## End Game Variants

### Perfect Clear Bonus
**Reward for capturing everything**

* If you capture ALL your cards (nothing remaining on your tableau at game end), add **+20 bonus points**
* This bonus is added after the final score calculation
* Encourages aggressive play and strategic risk-taking throughout the game

**Strategic Impact:** Creates a clear aspirational goal

---

### Set Collection Bonuses
**Bonus points for special achievements**

Award bonus points at game end for capturing:
* **All 4 of the same rank** (four of a kind): +10 bonus points
* **Rainbow sequence** (4 or more consecutive cards captured): +15 bonus points
* **All 4 wild 9's**: +25 bonus points
* Bonuses stack if you achieve multiple

**Strategic Impact:** Creates secondary objectives beyond just scoring points

---

### Negative Card Limit
**Harsh penalty for too many leftover cards**

* At game end, if you have 6 or more cards remaining on your tableau, your score is automatically set to 0
* Creates pressure to keep capturing throughout the game
* Best used with experienced players

**Strategic Impact:** Dramatically increases tension and forces active play

---

## Advanced Variants

### Power Cards
**Special abilities for specific card ranks**

When you capture these cards, immediately trigger their special ability:

* **Kings**: Immediately roll again and attempt another match (same turn)
* **Aces**: Choose one card from your tableau to discard permanently (reduces end-game penalty)
* **2's**: When captured as part of a pair or sequence, draw 2 cards from the deck and choose one to keep, discarding the other

**Strategic Impact:** Adds tactical depth and makes certain cards more valuable

---

### Auction Phase
**Bid for turn order**

* After the initial 9 cards are dealt to each player, conduct an auction
* Players bid by stating how many penalty cards they're willing to take onto their tableau
* The player willing to take the most penalty cards gets to choose their turn order position first
* Continue until all positions are filled
* Deal the penalty cards face-up to the respective players

**Strategic Impact:** Strategic players can optimize turn order based on their starting hand

---

### Wild Dice
**Add a third die for more control**

* Add a third die of a different color to the game
* Before rolling, you must roll all three dice
* After rolling, choose which 2 of the 3 dice to use for your total
* The unused die is ignored

**Alternative Version:**
* The third die determines a "wild rank" for that turn
* Any card matching that rank counts as matching your roll for that turn only

**Strategic Impact:** Reduces randomness and increases player agency

---

### King's Gambit
**Risk cards to reroll**

* After rolling, if you don't like your result, you may discard one card from your tableau permanently to reroll
* You must take the second roll (no additional rerolls)
* Can only be used once per turn

**Strategic Impact:** Provides an escape valve for bad rolls at a cost

---

## Creating Your Own Variants

The core mechanics of Finest 9 support many variations. When creating your own rules, consider:

* **Balance risk and reward:** The best rules make players choose between safety and opportunity
* **Keep it simple:** Rules should be explainable in 1-2 sentences
* **Add meaningful choices:** Good rules create interesting decisions, not just complexity
* **Maintain the pace:** Avoid rules that slow down the game significantly
* **Test iteratively:** Try one new rule at a time to see how it affects gameplay
